Suhasini Chandramouli, Apple Inc - Director of Investor Relations    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q2 fiscal year 2025 earnings conference call."
2,0,,,"My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations."
19,1,United States,500000000000.0,"And we are proud to increase our impact around the world, including here in the United States, where we recently announced plans to spend $500 billion over the next four years."
55,0,,,"From starting their morning with their podcast of choice to buying a coffee with Apple Pay to spending an afternoon reading the latest bestseller on Apple Books to using their favorite app from the App Store or an evening workout with Fitness+, Apple's Services are enriching our users' lives all throughout their day."
84,0,,,"However, for some color, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs."
86,0,,,"For our part, we will manage the company the way we always have, with thoughtful and deliberate decisions, with a focus on investing for the long term, and with dedication to innovation and the possibilities it creates."
103,0,,,Operating cash flow was also strong at $24 billion.
130,0,,,Organizations are investing more on Apple products and services to drive productivity and employee engagement.
137,0,,,We ended the quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities.
138,0,,,"We had $3 billion in debt maturities and increased commercial paper by $4 billion, resulting in $98 billion in total debt."
139,0,,,"Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $35 billion."
140,0,,,"During the quarter, we returned $29 billion to shareholders."
141,0,,,This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open-market repurchases of 108 million Apple shares.
142,1,share repurchases,100000000000.0,"Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today, our Board authorized an additional $100 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral."
149,0,,,"We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%, which includes the estimated impact of the $900 million of tariff-related costs that Tim referred to earlier."
151,0,,,"We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%."
153,0,,,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suhasini Chandramouli, Apple Inc - Director of Investor Relations    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We ask that you limit yourself to two questions."
170,0,,,"And so if you -- for the June quarter, as I talked about in my opening comments, we estimate the impact, assuming that the current global tariff, rates, policies, and applications don't change for the balance of the quarter, to be $900 million to our costs."
185,0,,,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ben Reitzes, Melius Research - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim, if you had told me that on April 2 that your hit from tariffs was only a $0.05-ish a quarter at $900 million, that would have been a pretty good outcome, given the panic that ensued."
244,0,,,"Tim, I think when you talked about the $900 million impact to your cost of goods sold, you sort of had a statement that there are certain unique factors that benefit you in the June quarter related to that number."
296,0,,,You quantified a $900 million hit from tariffs.
325,0,,,"When you look -- you look at velocity at the stores or trade down within the sort of iPhone portfolio mix, what are you seeing in terms of how the consumer is reacting to the macro at this point?"
334,0,,,"Tim, thanks for that information on the $500 billion US investment."
336,0,,,How much is CapEx versus R&D?
339,0,,,Any kind of color you can give on that $500 billion investment would be helpful.
342,1,expansion of facilities in multiple states,,"We're not giving out the exact split, but as we expand facilities in the different states from Michigan to Texas to California and Arizona and Nevada and Iowa and Oregon and North Carolina and Washington, there will be CapEx involved in that and OpEx involved in it."
344,0,,,"We do our manufacturing through a partner, but we'll be putting a fair amount in cost of goods sold to do that and some OpEx as well, and I'm sure some CapEx as well."
362,0,,,Or is it a matter of R&D spending?
373,0,,,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kevan Parekh, Apple Inc - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And Richard, I'll just add that on your question about investment that we don't underinvest in our business."
374,0,,,We make significant investments in R&D.
376,0,,,We're continuing to grow our R&D investment.
390,0,,,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suhasini Chandramouli, Apple Inc - Director of Investor Relations    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator, we will take our last question, please."
395,0,,,"And kind of dovetailed with that is that how do you think about your data center footprint when we look at Apple spending, call it, $3 billion a quarter relative to some of these other companies spending multiples of that."
399,0,,,"And as I've mentioned in the $500 billion, there's a number of states that we're expanding in."
402,0,,,"We invest in the business first, as Kevan talked about, is our most important thing to do."
411,0,,,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suhasini Chandramouli, Apple Inc - Director of Investor Relations    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Aaron."
412,0,,,A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.
433,0,,,"
