2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,2,"May 01, 2025","My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,19,"May 01, 2025","And we are proud to increase our impact around the world, including here in the United States, where we recently announced plans to spend $500 billion over the next four years."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,55,"May 01, 2025","From starting their morning with their podcast of choice to buying a coffee with Apple Pay to spending an afternoon reading the latest bestseller on Apple Books to using their favorite app from the App Store or an evening workout with Fitness+, Apple's Services are enriching our users' lives all throughout their day."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,84,"May 01, 2025","However, for some color, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,86,"May 01, 2025","For our part, we will manage the company the way we always have, with thoughtful and deliberate decisions, with a focus on investing for the long term, and with dedication to innovation and the possibilities it creates."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,103,"May 01, 2025",Operating cash flow was also strong at $24 billion.
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,130,"May 01, 2025",Organizations are investing more on Apple products and services to drive productivity and employee engagement.
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,137,"May 01, 2025",We ended the quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities.
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,138,"May 01, 2025","We had $3 billion in debt maturities and increased commercial paper by $4 billion, resulting in $98 billion in total debt."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,139,"May 01, 2025","Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $35 billion."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,140,"May 01, 2025","During the quarter, we returned $29 billion to shareholders."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,141,"May 01, 2025",This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open-market repurchases of 108 million Apple shares.
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,142,"May 01, 2025","Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today, our Board authorized an additional $100 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,149,"May 01, 2025","We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%, which includes the estimated impact of the $900 million of tariff-related costs that Tim referred to earlier."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,151,"May 01, 2025","We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,153,"May 01, 2025","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suhasini Chandramouli, Apple Inc - Director of Investor Relations    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We ask that you limit yourself to two questions."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,170,"May 01, 2025","And so if you -- for the June quarter, as I talked about in my opening comments, we estimate the impact, assuming that the current global tariff, rates, policies, and applications don't change for the balance of the quarter, to be $900 million to our costs."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,185,"May 01, 2025","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ben Reitzes, Melius Research - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim, if you had told me that on April 2 that your hit from tariffs was only a $0.05-ish a quarter at $900 million, that would have been a pretty good outcome, given the panic that ensued."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,244,"May 01, 2025","Tim, I think when you talked about the $900 million impact to your cost of goods sold, you sort of had a statement that there are certain unique factors that benefit you in the June quarter related to that number."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,296,"May 01, 2025",You quantified a $900 million hit from tariffs.
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,325,"May 01, 2025","When you look -- you look at velocity at the stores or trade down within the sort of iPhone portfolio mix, what are you seeing in terms of how the consumer is reacting to the macro at this point?"
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,334,"May 01, 2025","Tim, thanks for that information on the $500 billion US investment."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,336,"May 01, 2025",How much is CapEx versus R&D?
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,339,"May 01, 2025",Any kind of color you can give on that $500 billion investment would be helpful.
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,342,"May 01, 2025","We're not giving out the exact split, but as we expand facilities in the different states from Michigan to Texas to California and Arizona and Nevada and Iowa and Oregon and North Carolina and Washington, there will be CapEx involved in that and OpEx involved in it."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,344,"May 01, 2025","We do our manufacturing through a partner, but we'll be putting a fair amount in cost of goods sold to do that and some OpEx as well, and I'm sure some CapEx as well."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,362,"May 01, 2025",Or is it a matter of R&D spending?
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,373,"May 01, 2025","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kevan Parekh, Apple Inc - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And Richard, I'll just add that on your question about investment that we don't underinvest in our business."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,374,"May 01, 2025",We make significant investments in R&D.
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,376,"May 01, 2025",We're continuing to grow our R&D investment.
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,390,"May 01, 2025","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suhasini Chandramouli, Apple Inc - Director of Investor Relations    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator, we will take our last question, please."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,395,"May 01, 2025","And kind of dovetailed with that is that how do you think about your data center footprint when we look at Apple spending, call it, $3 billion a quarter relative to some of these other companies spending multiples of that."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,399,"May 01, 2025","And as I've mentioned in the $500 billion, there's a number of states that we're expanding in."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,402,"May 01, 2025","We invest in the business first, as Kevan talked about, is our most important thing to do."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,411,"May 01, 2025","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suhasini Chandramouli, Apple Inc - Director of Investor Relations    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Aaron."
2025-May-01-AAPL.OQ-139206802972-Transcript.txt,412,"May 01, 2025",A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2344,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","In iPad, revenue for the December quarter was $7 billion, down 25% year-over-year due to a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the tenth-generation iPad during the December quarter last year and 1 less week of sales."
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2349,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue came in at $12 billion, down 11% from a year ago due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year."
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2387,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","Products revenue was $96.5 billion, flat compared to last year, driven by strength in iPhone, offset by challenging compares for iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories and 1 less week of sales this year across the entire portfolio."
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2408,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","Also, 451 Research recently reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S.
iPad was $7 billion in revenue, down 25% year-over-year."
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2411,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","And customer satisfaction for iPad was recently measured at 98% in the U.S.
Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $12 billion, down 11% year-over-year due to a challenging launch compare and the extra week a year ago."
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2416,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely, establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our Services business."
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2427,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","Leading organizations across many industries such as Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg and SAP have started leveraging and investing in Apple Vision Pro as the new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to their customers and employees."
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2430,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024",We ended the quarter with $173 billion in cash and marketable securities.
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2431,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","We decreased commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion."
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2432,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","As a result, net cash was, $65 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash neutral over time remains unchanged."
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2433,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","During the quarter, we returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20.5 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares."
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2441,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024",We estimate that this impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter's total revenue last year.
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2446,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%."
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2592,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","You've heard from my prepared remarks that we are guiding total company gross margin to 46% to 47%, which is an additional expansion of margins compared to the already very strong results of the December quarter."
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2596,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024",One of the things that stands out for me is that your capital expenditures has actually come down this last year.
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2597,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","I'm curious, as you look to lean in more to generative AI, is there something we should consider about the CapEx intensity at Apple to make investments to really set the table for a generative AI kind of platform as we move forward, just given some of the things that we've seen from some other large tech companies?"
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2600,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024",And so we will continue to invest in every area of the business and at the appropriate level.
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2605,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","The $5 billion impact in March quarter, is this for product revenue or is that total company revenue?"
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2611,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024",The -- so the first part of the question was around the $5 billion.
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2612,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","The $5 billion, as I mentioned, a year ago, we had this disruption of supply on iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max because of the factory shutdown due to the COVID-19 situation."
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2616,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024",So the close to $5 billion that I mentioned is entirely related to iPhone.
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2618,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","And I'll repeat what I said before, we've had good expansion over the last few quarters, and now we are guiding to 46% to 47%, and that takes into account everything that is going on, which is the commodity environment, which is the foreign exchange situation, and obviously, the product and services mix."
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2635,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Vogt,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have 2 questions as well."
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2644,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","So when I think about the $5 billion pull-forward last year in the March quarter from a channel fill perspective, even if I backed that out last quarter or I back it up this quarter, the March quarter, this would be sort of the softest quarter since the COVID pandemic."
2024-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139920838259-Transcript.txt,2673,"FEBRUARY 01, 2024","A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone."

And I would add, Richard, on this front, some of the investments that we're making in R&D are also one of the drivers for the gross margin expansion."
2023-Nov-02-AAPL.OQ-140502977515-Transcript.txt,3133,"NOVEMBER 02, 2023","And I think the progress that we're making in Services, we did $85 billion in the last 12 months."

Operator    [7]

          We'll take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment Research."
2021-Jul-27-AAPL.OQ-138310703827-Transcript.txt,4207,"JULY 27, 2021","But we look at a world of pretty unprecedented, whether it be COVID, the Delta variant, China flood, supply chain components, just wondering for your like R&D and innovation, is it being materially impacted by that such where a normal cadence is unfair?"
2021-Jul-27-AAPL.OQ-138310703827-Transcript.txt,4252,"JULY 27, 2021","For example, a year ago, we were at 38.2%, so almost 400 basis points of expansion on a year-over-year basis, right?"

2021-Jul-27-AAPL.OQ-138310703827-Transcript.txt,4395,"JULY 27, 2021","So does that mean, thinking about the portfolio going forward, there is less of a need for a lower price product going forward?"
2021-Jul-27-AAPL.OQ-138310703827-Transcript.txt,4396,"JULY 27, 2021",And that the current portfolio and the new cycle going forward would be more high end in nature as we currently have today?

2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6753,"JANUARY 27, 2022","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Gala, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6766,"JANUARY 27, 2022","Through the busy holiday season, we set an all-time revenue record of nearly $124 billion, up 11% from last year and better than we had expected at the beginning of the quarter."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6799,"JANUARY 27, 2022","And we continue to invest in innovation across our services business, which set another all-time revenue record last quarter and performed even better than we had anticipated."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6801,"JANUARY 27, 2022","Since its launch, we have paid developers selling digital goods and services more than $260 billion, with 2021 setting a new record for their earnings."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6813,"JANUARY 27, 2022","In the last decade, this program has contributed nearly $725 million to charitable organizations."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6814,"JANUARY 27, 2022","We also celebrated 15 years of Apple's partnership with a global fund on (PRODUCT)RED, supporting their life-saving work to expand health care services in sub-Saharan Africa for people living with HIV/AIDS."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6815,"JANUARY 27, 2022","With the support of our customers, we've now raised nearly $270 million to fund prevention, testing and counseling services for people impacted by HIV/AIDS."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6841,"JANUARY 27, 2022",Operating cash flow of $47 billion was also an all-time record.
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6874,"JANUARY 27, 2022","Due to our strong operating performance and holiday quarter seasonality, we ended the quarter with $203 billion in cash plus marketable securities."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6875,"JANUARY 27, 2022","We decreased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $123 billion."

2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6877,"JANUARY 27, 2022","Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, and we were able to return nearly $27 billion to shareholders during the December quarter."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6879,"JANUARY 27, 2022","We also began $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 30 million shares."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6894,"JANUARY 27, 2022","We expect OI&E to be around negative $150 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6920,"JANUARY 27, 2022","And as you know, our Services portfolio is very broad and it contains businesses with very different margin profiles."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6922,"JANUARY 27, 2022","And so as a result, the Services gross margin percentage over time will be influenced by the relative growth of the different businesses within the portfolio."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6952,"JANUARY 27, 2022",You did almost $11 billion this quarter and you're still working through the M1 transition.
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,6954,"JANUARY 27, 2022","What are really sort of the target markets that you think you can go after in order to grow this beyond, I think it was about $37 billion in the last 12 months?"
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,7011,"JANUARY 27, 2022",And so we see a lot of potential in this space and are investing accordingly.
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,7031,"JANUARY 27, 2022","You folks are spending, I think, $23 billion on R&D in '21."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,7032,"JANUARY 27, 2022",So you're really spending a fair amount.
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,7033,"JANUARY 27, 2022","And maybe without telling us the road map, could you just talk about how do you think about where to focus your R&D resources on?"
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,7034,"JANUARY 27, 2022","And to some extent, is the way to think about this R&D spend, how much of it is really done on things that are more evolutionary in products that are out in the marketplace versus things that we haven't seen yet or on potential new offerings?"
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,7040,"JANUARY 27, 2022","In terms of deciding where we invest in, we look at areas that are sort of at the intersection of hardware, software and services, and because we think that, that's where the magic really happens and it brings out the best in Apple."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,7041,"JANUARY 27, 2022","And so there are areas that have more than piqued our interest, and we are investing in those."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,7042,"JANUARY 27, 2022",And you can tell through time that we've ramped our R&D spend even more than we were before.
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,7043,"JANUARY 27, 2022","And so there's quite a bit of investment going into things that are not on the market at this point, as there always are."
2022-Jan-27-AAPL.OQ-138984465849-Transcript.txt,7045,"JANUARY 27, 2022","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Vogt,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just wanted to dive in and get your perspective on China and sort of the macro climate there and how that sort of pertains to your business as we think about it going forward."

2022-Apr-28-AAPL.OQ-138491813375-Transcript.txt,8298,"APRIL 28, 2022",And I guess one of the things you said is that the $4 billion to $8 billion range reflects some reopening of facilities during the quarter.

2022-Apr-28-AAPL.OQ-138491813375-Transcript.txt,8307,"APRIL 28, 2022","But we planned various ramps for these, and that's the range of $4 billion to $8 billion that we've estimated."

Great."
2022-Apr-28-AAPL.OQ-138491813375-Transcript.txt,8342,"APRIL 28, 2022","Or do you actually consider like holding more buffer inventory internally because right now, letting $4 billion to $8 billion go away, it'd be nice to have that to be able to sell."
2022-Apr-28-AAPL.OQ-138491813375-Transcript.txt,8381,"APRIL 28, 2022","And really, it's those products that have powered the line and given us the overall results that we've had on iPhone, which, for the first half, the revenues were $120 billion, and we feel very, very good about those results."
2022-Apr-28-AAPL.OQ-138491813375-Transcript.txt,8389,"APRIL 28, 2022",This run rate of almost $20 billion is essentially double what we had just 4 years ago.

2022-Apr-28-AAPL.OQ-138491813375-Transcript.txt,8404,"APRIL 28, 2022","And that has served us very well because in the last 12 months, we've generated $75 billion of Services revenue, and you've seen the margins are obviously accretive to company margin."
2022-Apr-28-AAPL.OQ-138491813375-Transcript.txt,8415,"APRIL 28, 2022","And you also spoke about a $4 billion to $8 billion supply constraint, which is a large amount compared to the revenue, and I understand you have the supply constraints and the China shutdowns."
2022-Apr-28-AAPL.OQ-138491813375-Transcript.txt,8421,"APRIL 28, 2022","When we are giving out this range of $4 billion to $8 billion, it's not only silicon, but it's the restrictions in China that we're seeing right now."
2022-Apr-28-AAPL.OQ-138491813375-Transcript.txt,8440,"APRIL 28, 2022",We expect them to be in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion.
2022-Apr-28-AAPL.OQ-138491813375-Transcript.txt,8464,"APRIL 28, 2022","So your capital return strategy has been an extremely successful program in the past, but $90 billion is 3% of your market cap."

To give you a little more color on what we saw in the June quarter, we came in slightly below, from a constraint point of view, the $4 billion number that we had put at the -- the 4 to 8 are the low end of that range."

We believe in investing through the downturn."
2022-Jul-28-AAPL.OQ-139999304673-Transcript.txt,8911,"JULY 28, 2022","And so we'll continue to hire people and invest in areas, but we are being more deliberate in doing so in recognition of the realities of the environment."

2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9453,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","We estimate these constraints had around a $6 billion revenue dollar impact, driven primarily by industry-wide silicon shortages and COVID-related manufacturing disruptions."

2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9532,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","We set a September quarter revenue record of $83.4 billion, an increase of nearly $19 billion or 29% from a year ago despite larger-than-expected supply constraints."
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9535,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","On the products side, revenue was $65.1 billion, up 30% over a year ago as we experienced better-than-expected demand for our products despite supply constraints that we estimated at around $6 billion."
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9554,"OCTOBER 28, 2021",Our continued investment in iPad and Mac is taking computing to the next level.
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9566,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","Our continued investment and strong execution in Services has helped us deliver a record $68 billion in revenue during fiscal 2021, nearly tripling this category in 6 years."
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9576,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","During the past 12 months, we grew our business by 33% or $91 billion, reaching nearly $366 billion of revenue with record level performance across the board."

2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9580,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","We issued $6.5 billion of new term debt, retired $1.3 billion of term debt and decreased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $125 billion."

2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9582,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","As our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, we were also able to return $24 billion to shareholders during the September quarter."
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9583,"OCTOBER 28, 2021",This included $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20 billion through open market repurchases of 137 million Apple shares.
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9587,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","As we mentioned earlier, during the September quarter, supply constraints impacted our revenue by around $6 billion."
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9594,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%."
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9604,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","If you look at Q4 for a moment, we had about $6 billion in supply constraints, and it affected the iPhone, the iPad and the Mac."
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9612,"OCTOBER 28, 2021",But we believe that by the time we finish the quarter that the constraints will be larger than the $6 billion that we experienced in Q4.
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9620,"OCTOBER 28, 2021",And how should we think about percent maybe of the portfolio that's now available?
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9635,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","I guess when I think about the supply chain headwinds and you're talking about $6 billion in September and getting bigger in December, Tim, I would love to understand how do you guys comfort that this is really a demand that's getting deferred versus potentially getting destroyed at least somewhere else."
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9651,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","I think we've got a world-class one, and I'm sure they're doing everything they can do to collapse cycle times and improve yields and do all the things that you can do, in addition to fundamental capacity investment to remedy the situation."
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9664,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","Obviously, from a year-over-year standpoint, it's actually a significant expansion, right?"
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9665,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","Because when you look at what we did a year ago in the December quarter, 39.8%, this clearly indicates a significant expansion."
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9693,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Vogt,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great."
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9698,"OCTOBER 28, 2021",And how do you think about the current infrastructure and its ability to sort of rebound and sort of handle sort of these disruptions that seem to crop up from time to time?
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9715,"OCTOBER 28, 2021",We also support the CHIPS Act and the investment there to put more investment in the ground.
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9716,"OCTOBER 28, 2021",And so we're spending some time advocating for the CHIPS Act as well.

          Great."
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9789,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","And then probably for Luca on supply chain, when you mentioned supply chain headwind is going to get worse and you mentioned $6 billion this quarter, there's 2 ways to think about your terminology of worse."
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9790,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","Is it the delta from $2 billion that you identified 3 months ago that went to $6 billion, so therefore, the delta of $4 billion gets worse?"
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9791,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","Or are you just saying -- and therefore, it's above $10 billion for December quarter."
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9792,"OCTOBER 28, 2021",Are you just saying it just gets higher than the $6 billion that you just identified earlier in the call?
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9794,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","On the supply constraints, what we're saying is that the amount of -- the nominal amount of supply constraints for Q1, we estimate to be larger than $6 billion."
2021-Oct-28-AAPL.OQ-139435924054-Transcript.txt,9811,"OCTOBER 28, 2021","We're very fortunate we have a very -- now it's a very large business, $68 billion in the last 12 months and very diversified."

Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [33]

2018-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139637034005-Transcript.txt,15831,"FEBRUARY 01, 2018","When you talk about reducing your Apple's net cash levels to 0 effectively over time, I think that implies the number goes from $163 billion today to something like 0."
2018-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139637034005-Transcript.txt,15836,"FEBRUARY 01, 2018","And is that one reason, you get that number from $163 billion to 0?"
2018-Feb-01-AAPL.OQ-139637034005-Transcript.txt,15842,"FEBRUARY 01, 2018","And the thought process is always to acquire something that allows us to either accelerate our product road maps, filling a gap in our portfolio, providing a new experience to customers."
